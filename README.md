Files module
============
Files module 1.0.0 **for Zikula 1.3.0-6**

  - The module Files **allow users to manage their own files**. They can upload, rename, delete, zip and unzip files and folders. The users can decide if a folder is **public or private**. If a folder is set as public files stored in it are accessible trough the file file.php.
  - The administrators can set different **quotas** for different groups of users.
  - The module needs a folder where to store the users' files. In preference this folder must be located out of the public HTML. This folder (may be the same zkdata folder). Files folder contains the users folders and other content (if it is zkdata, all the files of other modules).
  - **Administrators also can manage the entire Files folder**.

Install notes
-------------
The module needs also a file named **file.php**, which must be located in the **root of the Zikula** installation. This file is needed to get the files from the public directories of the users. You can find this file in **Files/Resources/extras**, so you have to move it during the installation.

Working on 1.0.1 version (**branch dev**)
